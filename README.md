## Overview
This will be our Github Repository for the Hack USU 2024 competition.

### Objectives
The team will be attempting to create a true random number generator utilizing an IR emitter and reciever.

We hope that reflecting the emissions using rotating objects will randomize the recieving of IR emissions.

We will verify the randomness and use that randomness to create a simple game.

One of the judges mentioned a way to interpret the data by sight using our visual pattern finding as a way to tell if something is not random. This would take the approach of:
Mod the output to 256 or 128 or some number.
Assign the numbers to a grayscale 0-Black 128-White.
Print each value to a page as a pixel in that color and see if you can find patterns.
