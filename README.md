An overview of the project is as follows:
The team will be attempting to create a true random number generator utilizing an IR emitter and reciever.
We hope that reflecting the emissions using rotating objects will randomize the recieving of IR emissions.
We will verify the randomness and use that randomness to create a simple game.
