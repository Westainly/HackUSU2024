HACKATHON 2024

Team Name: 
IR Blasters

Team members:
Weston
Jakob
Magen
Jack (the pants)

Materials Needed:
Assortment of materials for obstructions. Solids, liquids, non-newtonian? Reflective (mirrors, Christmas Ornaments), rubber, glass, plastic, resin printed object.
Laptops with Arduino IDE for Arduino work.
Python
Github Repo


MVP 1:
IR emitter and receiver
objects in between IR components 
these may need to be spinning/moving for an additional factor
Ability to vary speeds
Allow both manual and automated speed control
emitter sends a full hex burst of FF FF FF FF
receiver catches a random hex stream
Entire contraption encased to contain emissions so things arenâ€™t just reflected out and nothing gets to the receiver

MVP 2:
If the resultant number is not random, manipulate it for perceived randomness.
Run received hex stream through random data analysis of sorts

MVP 3:
Take random number generated and use it
Create a program with a secondary (or the same) Arduino board to play a game of rock paper scissors or similar simple game
Use LEDs in labeled locations for each choice

MVP 4:
Make it all pretty
